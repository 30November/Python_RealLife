# About the grade.png Image #
First of all if you are getting upset/disapointment that it is not working
No worries this message will help you out

1. Simple Solution is to work (open) only on the MAKAUT Folder, not the main folder (Python_RealLife)

2. If you working as the whole (Folder: Python_RealLife) ,after clone, then you have to do following steps:
    - Copy the path of the grade.png
    - Paste the copied path in file "gpa.py" onto line 26 ,as file = <Ctrl + V>
    - Change all the '\' ,consist in the path into this '/'

3. Download the respective files (gpa.py and grade.png), and save both on the new Folder,or better download the MAKAUT folder. Run it and works well.


If neither of the above is sorted out or you are new into this. Then, regret to inform you that you can't see that GRADE RULE on the running program. For remove error, just make the line into comments (line: 26 to 28) and comment is done by typing '#' in each line of the code.
